This application is a path of my continued learning and practise of JavaFx and Java

BugIsland is a simulation of bugs: ant, beetle, ladybug, spider
The island contains plants, obstacles that the bugs move around, and food that the bugs move towards and can eat
The user can play, pause or restart the simulation at any time.
The user can click on each bug at any time to reveal their details.

Some features have not been implemented yet e.g: the bugs changing energy levels (decrease energy after a lengthy time of moving, and increase energy levels after eating a food source)
